Welcome to the "Weather Data Analysis & Prediction" project! This interactive Streamlit app analyzes historical weather data and predicts future temperature trends for major Indian cities (Delhi & Kolkata) using time series regression.

## About This Project

### What is Weather Data Analysis & Prediction?

This project provides interactive visualizations and predictions for daily temperature trends using real historical weather data. It is designed for anyone interested in climate trends, data science, or time series forecasting.

### How Does It Work?

The app uses a regression model (with lag features) to predict the next 7 days of maximum temperature for each city. You can explore:
- Daily and monthly temperature trends
- Seasonality heatmaps
- Interactive city selection (Delhi or Kolkata)
- Next 7 days' temperature predictions
